# PSUPRC OPFP Population Forecasts

.puz-left[
- For the purposes of land use planning PSUPRC generates population forecasts
- For counties, urban growth boundaries (UGBs), and areas outside UGBs
- These forecasts must
    - Be updated at least every four years
    - Cover a 50 year forecast horizon
    - Include most up to date data
    - Allow for public input/objections
    - Methods &amp; results publicly available

# Methods Review: Cohort Component Method

.pux-left[
- For Counties
- Births = Females 15-50 * Birth Rate
  - Both number of and rate of births in OR decreasing
- Deaths = All Population * Death Rate
  - While number of deaths are increasing rate of deaths decreasing
- Migration = Past migration events
  - Average of past migration is most likely scenario moving forward

# Methods Review: Housing Unit Method

.pull-left[
- For UGBs
- `\(P_t = P_{t-1} + \Delta HU*PPH*OCC\)`
- `\(PPH\)`: Persons per household
  - Estimated from most recent census data
- `\(OCC\)`: Occupancy Rate
  - Estimated from most recent census data
- `\(\Delta HU\)`: annual change in housing units
  - Modeled based on past housing unit growth trends
